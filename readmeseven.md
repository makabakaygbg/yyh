"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."

The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.

><font color=Gold>"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."</font>

And the roses were very much embarrassed.

"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby6 would think that my rose looked just like you-- the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars7 (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled8, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.

And he went back to meet the fox.

"Goodbye," he said.

"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."

><font color=Gold>"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</font>

"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."

"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.

><font color=Gold>"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."</font>

"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.

<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“再去看看那些玫瑰花吧。你一定会明白，你的那朵是世界上独一无二的玫瑰。你回来和我告别时，我再赠送给你一个秘密。”</br></font>
<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;于是小王子又去看那些玫瑰。</br></font>
<font face="楷体" color="DarkGreen"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“你们一点也不象我的那朵玫瑰，你们还什么都不是呢！”小王子对她们说。“没有人驯服过你们，你们也没有驯服过任何人。你们就象我的狐狸过去那样，它那时只是和千万只别的狐狸一样的一只狐狸。但是，我现在已经把它当成了我的朋友，于是它现在就是世界上独一无二的了。” </br></font>
<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;这时，那些玫瑰花显得十分难堪。</br></font>
<font face="楷体" color="DarkGreen"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“你们很美，但你们是空虚的。”小王子仍然在对她们说，“没有人能为你们去死。当然罗，我的那朵玫瑰花，一个普通的过路人以为她和你们一样。可是，她单独一朵就比你们全体更重要，因为她是我浇灌的。因为她是我放在花罩中的。因为她是我用屏风保护起来的。因为她身上的毛虫（除了留下两三只为了变蝴蝶而外）是我除灭的。因为我倾听过她的怨艾和自诩，甚至有时我聆听着她的沉默。因为她是我的玫瑰。” </br></font>
<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;他又回到了狐狸身边。</br></font>
<font face="楷体" ><br>&ensp;&ensp;“再见了。”小王子说道。</br></font>
<font face="楷体" ><br>&ensp;&ensp;“再见。”狐狸说。“喏，这就是我的秘密。很简单：只有用心才能看得清。实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。” </br></font>
<font face="楷体" color="DarkGreen"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。”小王子重复着这句话，以便能把它记在心间。 </br></font>
<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间，这才使你的玫瑰变得如此重要。” </br></font>
<font face="楷体" ><br>&ensp;&ensp;“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间…”小王子又重复着，要使自己记住这些。</br></font>
<font face="楷体" color="DarkGreen"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“人们已经忘记了这个道理，”狐狸说，“可是，你不应该忘记它。你现在要对你驯服过的一切负责到底。你要对你的玫瑰负责…” </br></font>
<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“我要对我的玫瑰负责…”小王子又重复着……</br></font>
