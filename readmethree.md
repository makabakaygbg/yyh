And I understood what he had been looking for.

I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.

><font color=Gold>"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden-- and they do not find in it what they are looking for."</font>

"They do not find it," I replied.

"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water."

"Yes, that is true," I said.

And the little prince added:

><font color=Gold>"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."</font>

I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?

"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.

<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;这时我才明白了他所要寻找的是什么!</br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;我把水桶提到他的嘴边。他闭着眼睛喝水。就象节日一般舒适愉快。这水远不只是一种饮料，它是披星戴月走了许多路才找到的，是在辘轳的歌声中，经过我双臂的努力得来的。它象是一件礼品慰藉着心田。在我小的时候，圣诞树的灯光，午夜的弥撒的音乐，甜蜜的微笑，这一切都使圣诞节时我收到的礼品辉映着幸福的光彩。</br></font>
 <font face="楷体" color=DarkGreen><br>&ensp;&ensp;“你这里的人在同一个花园中种植着五千朵玫瑰。”小王子说：“可是，他们却不能从中找到自己所要寻找的东西…” </br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“他们是找不到的。”我回答道。</br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“然而，他们所寻找的东西却是可以从一朵玫瑰花或一点儿水中找到的…” </br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;“一点不错。”我回答道。</br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;小王子又加了一句：</br></font>
 <font face="楷体" color=DarkGreen><br>&ensp;&ensp;“眼睛是什么也看不见的。应该用心去寻找。” </br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;我喝了水。我痛快地呼吸着空气。沙漠在晨曦中泛出蜂蜜的光泽。这蜂蜜般的光泽也使我感到幸福。为什么我要难过…</br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;小王子又重新在我的身边坐下。他温柔地对我说：“你应该实践你的诺言。”</br></font>
