><font color=Gold>"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"</font>

"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."

As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."

<font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;小王子睡觉了，我就把他抱在怀里，又重新上路了。我很激动。就好象抱着一个脆弱的宝贝。就好象在地球上没有比这更脆弱的了。我借着月光看着这惨白的面额，这双紧闭的眼睛，这随风飘动的绺绺头发，这时我对自己说道：“我所看到的仅仅是外表。最重要的是看不见的…” </br></font>
<font face="楷体" color=DarkGreen><br>&ensp;&ensp;由于看到他稍稍张开的嘴唇露出一丝微笑，我又自言自语地说：“在这个熟睡了的小王子身上，使我非常感动的，是他对他那朵花的忠诚，是在他心中闪烁的那朵玫瑰花的形象。这朵玫瑰花，即使在小王子睡着了的时候，也象一盏灯的火焰一样在他身上闪耀着光辉…”这时，我就感觉到他更加脆弱。应该保护灯焰：一阵风就可能把它吹灭…</br></font>
 <font face="楷体"><br>&ensp;&ensp;于是，就这样走着，我在黎明时发现了水井。</br></font>
